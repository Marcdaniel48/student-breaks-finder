## How to Run
You should be able to run this normally with Android Studio; however, it is possible that the API tokens have been changed or renewed since they shouldn't be shown in the first place (OpenWeather and Firebase). In that case, you can either run a limited app or make your own tokens and can replace the ones in this project with them.

You will also need to import the `info.json` into your Realtime database and configure a username and password (replace the one in these files).
